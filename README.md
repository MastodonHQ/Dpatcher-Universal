Dpatcher-Linux
==============

Linux Version of Dpatcher, a file patcher for destinia

Coded by MastodonHQ(MastodonHQ@gmail.com) aka Celtrix (Aquertu@gmail.com)
Licensed under GPL v3 see license for details

NOTE: This was written for version 1.0.1 of destinia I'm relatively certain this won't work on newer versions (they probably changed the save file format),
and I just tried it on the latest version of destinia for android and it doesn't work.

Pretty much do whatever with it as long as you state that I was the original author/coder of the patcher somewhere
in your package/documentation and keep the GPL v3 license with it.
